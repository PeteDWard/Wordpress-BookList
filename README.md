# Wordpress-BookList
A WordPress plugin that creates a custom post type for Books.

This pluign is a simple custom post type that includes the features of the "normal" post type, except for revision histories.

The custom fields the plugin introduces are for "ISBN", "Number of Pages", "Publisher", "First Publication Date" and "ISBN" which is a required field.

When the post is saved all of these fields appropriately formatted, i.e. "Number of Pages" is a numeric, and "First Publication Date" a date.

The ISBN field, if supplied, is displayed in the list of posts shown in the WordPress admin screen.
