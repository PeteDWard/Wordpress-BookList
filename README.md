# Wordpress-BookList
A WordPress plugin that creates a custom post type for Books.

A simple custom post type, as a Plugin, that includes the features of a "normal" post and introduces some extra fields for "ISBN", "Number of Pages", "Publisher", "First Publication Date" and "ISBN" which is a required field.

When the post is saved all of these fields appropriately formatted, i.e. "Number of Pages" is a numeric, and "First Publication Date" a date.

The ISBN field, if supplied, is displayed in the list of posts shown in the WordPress admin screen.
